Developed a console-based Tic Tac Toe game in Python, offering engaging gameplay for both Player vs Player (PVP) and Player vs Computer (PVC) modes. The project focuses on combining Python programming, file handling, and data visualization to create an interactive and dynamic gaming experience. 

Key features include:
Game Modes: PVP mode for multiplayer interaction and PVC mode with two difficulty levels (Moderate and Hard) for AI-based challenges.
High Score Tracking: Utilized JSON for persistent storage of wins, losses, and draws across sessions.
Data Visualization: Displayed win/draw statistics using pie charts generated with the Matplotlib library.
Input Validation: Ensured accurate and valid user inputs, enhancing gameplay reliability.
Interactive Features: Dynamic board updates and the ability to resume or replay games.
This project demonstrates practical application of Python programming concepts, including data structures, algorithm design, and user interface development. Future improvements include implementing a GUI, advanced AI strategies, and an online multiplayer mode.
